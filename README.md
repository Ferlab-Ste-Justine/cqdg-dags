# About

This is a repo for all the dags that are specific to the CQDG project.

# Updating DAGs

To add a DAG, just create a new directory and put your DAG in it.

Otherwise, do any changes you need to perform on the DAGs and merge to the **main** branch. The changes will get propagated automatically.
